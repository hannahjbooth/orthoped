        <h2>What is the OrthoPed Foot Drop Splint?</h2>
        <p> The OrthoPed Foot Drop Splint has been specially designed to help people with conditions
            which mean they find it more difficult to lift the front of their foot. The splint is patented
            and has been designed to allow people with foot drop to walk in a more typical way, with
            more energy efficiency and to reduce falls. The OrthoPed splint can be worn with Velcro
            fastening or lace up shoes. It has been rigorously tested in a laboratory by the National
            Physical Laboratory and in clinical studies in conjunction with the University of Portsmouth
            and 2 NHS Trusts. We have been supported by funding from <a href="https://www.ukri.org/councils/innovate-uk/">Innovate UK</a>, <a href="https://iuk.ktn-uk.org/business-growth/">Innovate UK
            EDGE</a>, <a href="https://www.ukri.org">UK Research and Innovation</a> and <a href="https://www.sightprogramme.co.uk">SIGHT</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>
            OrthoPed was established by Claire Narborough, a physiotherapist, out of frustration with
            current products on the market for people with moderate foot drop. In 2018 Claire made
            the first few designs for the OrthoPed splint with help from her mother-in-law's sewing skills
            and sewing machine. This allowed her to quickly and continually develop the splint. In 2019
            she set up the company, OrthoPed Ltd, and started applying for grant funding to allow her
            to develop the splint further.
        </p>    
        <p>
            Claire was successful with multiple rounds of grant funding from 2020 - present, which has
            allowed her to have the OrthoPed splint tested in a laboratory, in clinical studies with
            patients and fast-track the development of both the splint and the business. In 2022 and
            2023, she was successful in her applications for 2 larger grants from Innovate UK, along with
            some smaller ERDF funded grants. These have allowed Claire to commence clinical studies
            of the OrthoPed splint in children and adults and allowed her to complete the
            documentation needed to comply with the regulatory requirements needed to place the
            OrthoPed splint on the UK market.
