            <h2>What is the OrthoPed Foot Drop Splint?</h2>
                <p>The OrthoPed Foot Drop Splint has been specially designed to help people with conditions
                which mean they find it more difficult to lift the front of their foot.</p>
                
                <p>The splint is patented and has been designed to allow people with foot drop to walk in a more typical way, with
                more energy efficiency and to reduce falls. The OrthoPed splint can be worn with Velcro
                fastening or lace up shoes.</p>
                
                <p>It has been rigorously tested in a laboratory by the National Physical Laboratory and in clinical studies in conjunction with the University of Portsmouth
                and 2 NHS Trusts. We have been supported by funding from <a href="https://www.ukri.org/councils/innovate-uk/">Innovate UK</a>, <a href="https://iuk.ktn-uk.org/business-growth/">Innovate UK

                <h2>Our History</h2>
                <p>
                    OrthoPed was established by Claire Narborough, a physiotherapist, out of frustration with
                    current products on the market for people with moderate foot drop. In 2018 Claire made
                    the first few designs for the OrthoPed splint with help from her mother-in-law's sewing skills
                    and sewing machine. This allowed her to quickly and continually develop the splint. In 2019
                    she set up the company, OrthoPed Ltd, and started applying for grant funding to allow her
                    to develop the splint further.
                </p>    
                <p>
                    Claire was successful with multiple rounds of grant funding from 2020 - present, which has
                    allowed her to have the OrthoPed splint tested in a laboratory, in clinical studies with
                    patients and fast-track the development of both the splint and the business. In 2022 and
                    2023, she was successful in her applications for 2 larger grants from Innovate UK, along with
                    some smaller ERDF funded grants. These have allowed Claire to commence clinical studies
                    of the OrthoPed splint in children and adults and allowed her to complete the
                    documentation needed to comply with the regulatory requirements needed to place the
                    OrthoPed splint on the UK market.
